# FULL-FEATURED-BACKEND-APPLICATION
Welcome to the Full Featured Backend Application! This project leverages the power of FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and PostgreSQL to create a robust and scalable backend. It features user authentication and authorization using JWT, integrates Google OAuth 2.0 for seamless login experiences, and connects with the Zoom API to schedule virtual meetings effortlessly.

# Why this project?
In today's fast-paced digital world, companies need to provide quick and efficient ways for users to access their services. This project addresses that need by enabling virtual consultations, reducing the need for physical meetings, and providing a seamless experience for both users and service providers.

## Setting up the Google Cloud Console project

To ensure that Google OAuth works as expected, you'll need to configure a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome/new?_ga=2.117443785.-1160546546.1718048896). 

1. Create a new project

    ![Step 2](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step2.png)
    ![Step 3](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step3.png)
    ![Step 4](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step4.png)

 2. Set up the OAuth consent screen

    ![Step 6](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step6.png)
    ![Step 7](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step7.png)
    ![Step 8](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step8.png)
    ![Step 9](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step9.png)
    ![Step 10](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step10.png)
In this step, keep in mind that **`only the Gmail accounts you add here are the ones that are going to be able to log in when you're testing the API.`**
    ![Step 11](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step11.png)

4. Get the credentials

    ![Step 13](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step13.png)
    ![Step 14](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step14.png) 

    ![Step 15](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step15.png)
    **`The Authorized redirect URIs must be the same url that the one in this part of the code. `**
    ![Emphasis](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Emphasis.png)
Remember these credentials because you're going to need them later.
    ![Step 16](/assets/Zoom-Tuto/Step16.png)

## Setting up the Zoom account application

You'll also need to create a zoom application, specifically a Server-to-Server OAuth. This step is neccessary to get the Zoom
credentials to ensure the meeting scheduling works as expected. 

You can easily get the credentials by following the [Zoom Documentation](https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/)
After you have created the app, you can go to your [apps](https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/build) and click on the project you
just created. 

There you shall see a screen like this
    ![Zoom app Dashboard](/assets/ZoomApp.png)

Keep these credentials at hand because you'll need them later.

## Setting up the gmail account from which the e-mails will be sent

To set this up, you must have access to the Gmail account set up to send emails, such as a noreply@gmail.com or whatever the account is.
Then follow these steps to generate a Password Application.

![Step 1](/assets/Google-App-Tuto/GStep1.png)
![Step 2](/assets/Google-App-Tuto/GStep2.png)
![Step 3](/assets/Google-App-Tuto/GStep3.png)
![Step 4](/assets/Google-App-Tuto/GStep4.png)

Make sure you copy this password because you'll never see it again.

## Setting up the `.env` file

The next step is to configure the **.env** file. As you can see in the repository, there is a **`.env.example`** file, and you must replace 
some of the credentials and passwords we generated before.

Create a new `.env` file and fill it with the following information:

```ini
# PostgreSQL Database Configuration
POSTGRES_USER=postgres                      # Don't change it
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password    # Choose a password
POSTGRES_DB=RESTAPI-DB                      # Don't change it 
POSTGRES_DB_HOST=db                         # Don't change it
POSTGRES_DB_PORT=5432                       # Don't change it

# Replace the values above here in the url
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your_postgres_password@db:5432/RESTAPI-DB
```

Here you can leave everything as it is, except for the **POSTGRES_PASSWORD** just choose a password and replace it both in the 
variable and in the URL

```ini
# Secret Keys
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY=your_access_token_secret_key
EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_SECRET_KEY=your_email_confirmation_secret_key
PASSWORD_RESET_SECRET_KEY=your_password_reset_secret_key
GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRET_KEY=your_google_oauth_secret_key
```

Your secret keys could be any string, but it is better for the security of the API to generate a long and more secure string.
You can generate it using this command in the terminal:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```
As a result, it'll generate a long string like this **`210b48bdfe0d703e820b93361e3178add9f18af8d0fadfecdd508446a780cc29`**.
I suggest, generating a different string for each Secret Key and replace it up there.

```ini
# Zoom API Configuration
ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=your_zoom_client_id
ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_zoom_client_secret
ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID=your_zoom_account_id
```

Here you will have to replace those default values for the ones you got from creating the Zoom Server-to-Server Application.
Account ID, Client ID and Client Secret.

```ini
# Mail Configuration
MAIL_USERNAME=your_mail_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_mail_password
MAIL_FROM=your_mail_from_address
```

- In the **MAIL_USERNAME** and **MAIL_FROM** fill it with the gmail direction you used to create the password application to send the emails
- In the **MAIL_PASSWORD** fill it with the password Google gave you when you created the password application. 


```ini
# Google OAuth Configuration
GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRET_CLIENT=your_google_oauth_secret_client
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
```

In the **GOOGLE_OAUTH_SECRET_CLIENT** fill it with the Client Secret given when creating the project with Google Cloud Console.
In the **GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID** fill it with the Clien ID given when creating the project with Google Cloud Console.
